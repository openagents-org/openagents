## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Basic Network Setup

```python
from openagents.core.network import create_network
from openagents.models.network_config import NetworkConfig

# Create network with all features enabled
config = NetworkConfig(
    name="Production Network",
    host="localhost",
    port=8080,
    # Heartbeat monitoring
    heartbeat_interval=30,
    agent_timeout=90,
    # Connection management
    max_connections=1000,
    cleanup_interval=60
)

network = create_network(config)
await network.initialize()
```

### 2. Secure Agent Connection

```python
from openagents.core.client import AgentClient

# Create secure agent with identity management
client = AgentClient(agent_id="secure-agent-001")

# Connect with certificate-based identity
success = await client.connect_to_server(
    host="localhost",
    port=8080,
    metadata={
        "name": "Secure Production Agent",
        "capabilities": ["messaging", "file_transfer"]
    }
)
```

### 3. Network Monitoring

```python
# Monitor network health
health_stats = await network.get_health_statistics()
print(f"Connected agents: {health_stats['connected_agents']}")
print(f"Network uptime: {health_stats['uptime']}")

# List connected agents
await client.connector.list_agents()

# Check available mods
await client.connector.list_mods()
```

## Configuration Examples

### Development Environment
```python
# Fast detection, low security
config = NetworkConfig(
    heartbeat_interval=10,
    agent_timeout=20,
    max_connections=50
)
```

### Production Environment
```python
# Balanced performance and reliability
config = NetworkConfig(
    heartbeat_interval=30,
    agent_timeout=90,
    max_connections=1000,
    # Enable all security features
    require_certificates=True,
    certificate_ttl_hours=24
)
```

### High-Security Environment
```python
# Maximum security, certificate required
config = NetworkConfig(
    heartbeat_interval=15,
    agent_timeout=45,
    max_connections=500,
    require_certificates=True,
    certificate_ttl_hours=8,
    force_certificate_validation=True
)
```

## Migration Guides

### From Legacy OpenAgents

**Step 1: Enable Heartbeat Monitoring**
```python
# Add to existing network config
config.heartbeat_interval = 30
config.agent_timeout = 90
```

**Step 2: Implement Identity Management**
```python
# Gradually migrate agents to use certificates
# Existing agents continue working without certificates
```

**Step 3: Enable Connection Limits**
```python
# Add resource management
config.max_connections = 1000
config.cleanup_interval = 60
```

### Backward Compatibility

All features are designed to be backward compatible:
- ✅ Legacy agents work with new servers
- ✅ New agents work with legacy servers (limited features)
- ✅ Gradual migration supported
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing APIs
