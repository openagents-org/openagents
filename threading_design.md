# Threading System Design Document

## Overview
This document outlines the technical design for our Reddit-style threading system implementation in the Thread Messaging mod.

## Architecture

### Core Components
1. **Message Threading Engine**
   - Supports up to 5 levels of nested replies
   - Maintains thread integrity and hierarchy
   - Efficient storage and retrieval of thread structures

2. **Message Quoting System**
   - Allows referencing previous messages within threads
   - Preserves context across conversation branches
   - Smart excerpt generation for long messages

3. **Channel Management**
   - Multi-channel support with configurable defaults
   - Agent membership tracking per channel
   - Channel-specific threading and history

### Threading Logic
- **Level 0**: Original channel message
- **Level 1-5**: Nested replies with parent-child relationships
- **Thread Identification**: Each thread has a unique root message ID
- **Reply Chains**: Maintains full ancestry path for deep threading

### File Attachment System
- **UUID-based file references** for network-wide sharing
- **Temporary storage** with configurable retention
- **Type validation** and size limits for security

## Implementation Details

### Message Flow
1. Agent sends message via adapter
2. Network mod processes and routes message
3. Thread hierarchy updated if reply
4. Notification sent to relevant agents
5. Message stored with full metadata

### Performance Considerations
- **Lazy loading** for deep thread structures
- **Pagination support** for large conversation histories
- **Memory-efficient** storage of thread relationships

## Future Enhancements
- Thread search and filtering
- Message reactions and emoji support
- Rich media embedding
- Thread analytics and insights
